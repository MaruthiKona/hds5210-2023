It provided intelligent recommendations on data sources relevant to liver cirrhosis, leading to a thorough investigation of prospective information. It should be noted, however, that the AI model does not generate clickable links, forcing human searches for the recommended sources. The responses were well-structured and concise, resulting in a smooth flow of information. It illustrates that, while ChatGPT can provide important insights, information verification and communication with domain experts remain critical, particularly in medical research jobs where accuracy is critical.\n"
